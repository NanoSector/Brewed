## Compatibility

macOS 11.0+

This app does need homebrew installed and will not function without it.
Make sure to run `brew services` at least once so that the tap gets installed.

## Roadmap

See the Issues and Projects pages in this repo.

## Building

Open in Xcode and build like normal; dependencies should be resolved automatically using Swift Package Manager.

Dependencies:
- [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit)
